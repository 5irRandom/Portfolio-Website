                    <br /> 
                    <p>Honestly I'm not all that interesting, I'm based in Austin Texas, I know a few coding languages but not enough to do it professionally yet, I'm currently 20 years old.
                    I dropped out of college back in 2019, got a job and went through some things before deciding to pursue coding as a career, leading to being in this class.
                    Some more interesting things are that I enjoy messing with computers, I really like a good video game, I'm usually down to try my hand at new things as I learn quickly.
                    On a different note some artists I enjoy are Sabaton, Gloryhammer, Master Boot Record, and a few others along those lines, I've linked some of my favorite songs below.
                    I really enjoy a good laugh, I've been told I've got a great sense of humor, though I have also been told that I'm rather awkward, I think those 2 might be related.
                    I grew up in Michigan up until around 2016, other than that I don't really know what else to put here.</p>

                    <p>Yes I know that last one is an entire album but its unfair to split up the 2 songs it contains</p>
